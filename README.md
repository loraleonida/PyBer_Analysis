# PyBer_Analysis


## Overview of Project
Performed data analysis for PyBer, a ride sharing company, in order to determine how the data differs for each city type. Data visualizations were created to showcase the relationship between the type of city and the number of drivers, riders, total fares, average fare per ride, and average far per driver.

## Results

The results show that urban cities have the most drivers, riders, and highest total fares followed by suburban and then rural cities respectively. However, the rural cities have the highest average fare per ride and average fare per driver, followed by suburban and urban cities respectively. This is shown in the table below:

The results from the line graph show that the urban cities have higher total weekly fares compared to suburban and rural cities.

## Summary
Based on the results, three business recommendations for the CEO to address disparities among the city types would be:

1. To decrease the number of drivers in urban areas. The number of drivers far outweigh the number of rides, and urban rides are the least profitable rides of all three city types.
2. To increase the number of drivers in rural areas. The rural city rides are the most profitable rides of all three city types, so I would increase drivers in this city type to maximize the number of rides and therefore increase profitability for the company and for the driver.
3. To increase the number of drivers in suburban areas. The suburban city rides are the second most profitable rides of the 3 city types. So again, I would increase drivers in this city type to maximize the number of rides and therefore increase profitability for the company and for the driver.
