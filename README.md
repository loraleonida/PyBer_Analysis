# PyBer_Analysis


## Overview of Project
Performed data analysis for ride sharing company in order to determine how the data differs for each city type. Data visualizations were created to showcase the relationship between the type of city and the number of drivers, riders, total fares, average fare per ride, and average far per driver.

## Results

The analysis of the results show that:

The results show that there is a direct correlation between city type and the ride sharing data. The data shows there is a positive correlation between city type population and the number of drivers, riders, and total fares. You can see from the table that urban areas have the most drivers, riders, and highest total fares followed by suburban and then rural areas respectively. However, the city type population and the average fare per ride and average fare per driver seem to be inversely correlated. The rural cities have the highest average fare per ride and average fare per driver, followed by suburban and urban cities respectively.

The results from the line graph show a positive correlation between the total weekly fares and city type population. The urban cities have higher weekly fares compared to suburban and rural cities. 



## Summary
Based on the results, three business recommendations for the CEO to address disparities among the city types would be:
	1. To decrease the number of drivers in urban areas. The number of drivers far outweigh the number of rides, and urban rides are the least profitable rides of all 3 city types.
	2. To increase the number of drivers in rural areas. The rural city rides are the most profitable rides of all 3 city types, so I would increase drivers in this city type to maximize rides and therefore increase profitability for the company and for the driver.
	3. To increase the number of drivers in suburban areas. The suburban city rides are the second most profitable rides of the 3 city types. So again, I would increase drivers in this city type to maximize rides and therefore increase profitability for the company and for the driver.
